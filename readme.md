# Weekly Nerds
In this repository you'll find all the articles I wrote about all the Weekly Nerd I've had during the Minor Web Development at the University of applied sciences Amsterdam. The Weekly Nerd is a talk of a person in the work field of the study Communication and multimedia Design. They talk about accesibility, developing websites and their own experience they've had during their journey.
